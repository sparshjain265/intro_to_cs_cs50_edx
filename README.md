# intro_to_cs_cs50_edx
This repository is created to take notes, complete assignments, and track progress on the Introduction to Computer Science course (CS50) on EdX.

To build `notes.pdf` from `notes.tex`:
  - Use `bash precompile.sh` to create preamble.fmt before building the main latex document.
  - Use argument `--shel-escape` in your latex build rule. Required for `minted` package.

All databases are compressed to `.tar.xz` format.
